Welcome to our community. We are an open community and aim to be welcoming to all.

Please follow these simple rules...

Decorum:
1) No profanity (swearing) or sexualised language. Some people will be offended by it, and the forums are designed to be a comfortable environment for everybody.
2) Stay polite and don't intimidate. If someone is not being polite, report the post, don't escalate the situation.
3) Do not spoil the experience of others for your own petty reasons.

The obvious:
1) Do not try and impersonate anybody else.
2) Do not try and hack anybody, or spread viruses.
3) Do not intentionally undermine the privacy of other users, e.g. doxxing.
4) Do not do any kind of illegal activity, such as promoting illicit drug use, grooming children, or any kind of criminal incitement.

Regarding moderation:
 - These rules may be enforced at the discretion of the moderators, with whatever punitive actions considered appropriate (warnings, post deletions, post edits, closing topics, bans, etc).
 - Moderators also have the right to intercede for any reason if they feel it is important to maintain a quality experience for the users.
 - Moderators have the ability to read private content, such as private topics and inline personal posts.

Liability:
1) It is user's own responsibility to scan content for viruses, etc.
2) Any user breaking intellectual property laws is personally liable for it.
