					<h3>How do we do it?</h3>

					<p>Take a look inside our usual full-agency website design process *3:</p>

					<p>The process begins with you submitting your requirements. There is no "one size fits all": every web solution we do is written to the needs of that customer. We work to agree on a website development plan with a fixed-price quote, then submit diagrams and screen designs for approval.</p>

					<p>After you sign-off, our website development begins. This phase includes regular progress updates plus thorough testing where we critically review our work against a wide range of quality and standards compliance criteria. Then we prepare a live demo for you to evaluate.</p>

					<p>When everyone is happy, we deploy the new website, and remain on-call for further support needs with our Experts by the Hour service.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="tabscontent" id="contentz2">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<h3>What do we charge?</h3>

				<p>For all full-agency developments, we charge our standard hourly rates which incorporate all our development costs. Currently:</p>

				<p><strong>Web designer:</strong> <span class="highLt">£40 GBP</span> per hour.<br />
				<strong>Web developer:</strong> <span class="highLt">£60 GBP</span> per hour.<br />
				<strong>Project manager:</strong><span class="highLt">£40 GBP</span> per hour.</p>

				<p>Prices typically start from about £2,500 GBP for a professionally designed website, with £10,000 GBP being a typical amount for a website with a lot of awesome-new functionality.</p>

				<p>You will receive your initial quote once we have identified your particular needs.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="tabscontent" id="contentz3">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<h3>What to provide us</h3>

				<p>It is best if you can provide detailed specifications to design for, because it reduces the risk of misunderstanding and things go much more quickly.</p>

				<p>Examples:</p>

				<p>&bull; Website objectives<br />
				&bull; Feature lists for development<br />
				&bull; Sketches of how screens should look (if you have strong ideas in this area)<br />
				&bull; Descriptions of behaviour</p>

			<p>We don't do Flash websites. We work to [url="W3C standards"]http://www.w3.org/standards/[/url] (the proper standards for consistent reliable accessible web-sites), and Flash isn't one of these. Flash won't work on iPads or iPhones, hurts search result positions, and is considered by some a 'rogue' tool in web-design. Modern websites can still be very flashy without needing Adobe Flash. Where it is needed (usually, for online games) we'll partner up with a specialist.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="sept"></div>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>*1 &ndash; sometimes we'll put you in touch with one of our partner companies to provide your solution, in which case your business relationship and the project responsibility would be with this partner company and not ocProducts. These companies are chosen by ocProducts due to their experience of Composr, their established working relationship with the developers, and their experience running projects. They will often subcontract the most technical work back to ocProducts. We do this so we can focus on continuing to develop the world-class Composr technology, and because ocProducts doesn't always have the free staff capacity to run large projects when other trusted companies do. Also sometimes other experienced companies are better placed geographically to lead a project.</p>

	<p>*2 &ndash; this is usually the case, but some projects may differ. The negotiated project scope takes precedence over what is discussed on this page.</p>

	<p>*3 &ndash; our partner companies may have other processes, or the process may be tuned differently according to the needs of your project. The exact process should be confirmed during initial discussions.</p>

	<p>*4 &ndash; for longer distance travel, we will usually need to charge for travel time and costs</p>

	<p>*5 &ndash; if taking a quote would take a long time, we may give a price range indication while seeking to confirm you have a realistic budget, after which we'll produce a more accurate quote</p>
