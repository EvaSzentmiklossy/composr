					<h3>How do we do it?</h3>

					<p>Take a look inside our usual agency website design process <sup>*3</sup>:</p>

					<p>The process begins with you submitting your requirements. There is no "one size fits all": every web solution we do is written to the needs of that customer. We work to agree on a website development plan with either a fixed-price quote or a secondment agreement, then submit diagrams and screen designs for approval.</p>

					<p>After you sign-off, our website development begins. This phase includes regular progress updates plus thorough testing where we critically review our work against a wide range of quality and standards compliance criteria. Then we prepare a live demo for you to evaluate.</p>

					<p>When everyone is happy, we deploy the new website, and remain on-call for further support needs with our professional support or secondment services.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="tabscontent" id="contentz2">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<h3>What do we charge?</h3>

				<p>For all agency developments, we charge our standard hourly rates which incorporate all our development costs. Currently:</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Web designer:</strong> [currency="GBP" bracket="1"]40[/currency] per hour &nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<strong>Web developer:</strong> [currency="GBP" bracket="1"]60[/currency] per hour &nbsp;&nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					<strong>Project manager:</strong> [currency="GBP" bracket="1"]40[/currency] per hour<br />
					(<a title="ocProducts rate card {!LINK_NEW_WINDOW}" target="_blank" href="{$BASE_URL*}/uploads/website_specific/compo.sr/ocproducts_rate_card.pdf">full rate card</a>)
				</p>

				<p>Prices typically start from about [currency="GBP" bracket="1"]3000[/currency] for a professionally designed website.</p>
				<p>Web pricing can seem like a dark art. As an Open Source company, we also believe in open pricing:<br />For a discussion about typical pricing in the web design industry, see our <a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,docs:sup_pricing}">pricing tutorial</a>.</p>
				<p>We charge around the same as other established UK/US agencies, but for this you get a company with extraordinary authority and expertise.</p>

				<p>After containing us we have discuss your particular needs, before coming to a free no-obligation quote.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="tabscontent" id="contentz3">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<h3>What to provide us</h3>

				<p>It is best if you can provide detailed specifications to design for; it reduces the risk of misunderstanding and things go much more quickly.</p>

				<p class="lonely_label">Examples:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Website objectives</li>
					<li>Feature lists for development</li>
					<li>Sketches of how screens should look (if you have strong ideas in this area)</li>
					<li>Descriptions of behaviour</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Our <a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,:contact:project}">Briefr</a> system will step through most of the things you need to think about.</p>

				<p>Alternatively, we can prepare it all through an in-person consultation process <sup>*4</sup>.</p>

				<p>Ideally, start simple. See our "Project management and funding methodology" section below.</p>

			<div class="sept"></div>

			<p>A lot (possibly the majority) of companies cut-corners and generally do a shoddy job, after selling you on a slick pitch. We've put together a tutorial explaining <a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,docs:sup_choosing_a_developer}">how to pick a developer</a>. We're upfront about our processes and costs: most companies advertise their lowest quotes but have their highest-budget projects in their portfolio.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="sept"></div>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>*1 &ndash; sometimes we'll put you in touch with one of our partner companies to provide your solution, in which case your business relationship and the project responsibility would be with this partner company and not ocProducts. These companies are chosen by ocProducts due to their experience of Composr, their established working relationship with the developers, or their experience and proximity to you. They will often subcontract the most technical work back to ocProducts. We do this so we can focus on continuing to develop the world-class Composr technology, and because ocProducts doesn't always have the free staff capacity to run large projects when other trusted companies do.</p>
	<p>*2 &ndash; this is usually the case, but some projects may differ. The negotiated project scope takes precedence over what is discussed on this page.</p>
	<p>*3 &ndash; our partner companies may have other processes, or the process may be tuned differently according to the needs of your project.<br />The exact process should be confirmed during initial discussions.</p>
	<p>*4 &ndash; for longer distance travel, we will usually need to charge for travel time and costs. We are based in Sheffield, UK.</p>
	<p>*5 &ndash; if taking a quote would take a long time, we may give a price range indication while seeking to confirm you have a realistic budget.<br />After this we'll produce a more accurate quote</p>
