[title="2"]We're not all about technology[/title]

[title="2"]The world-class web development team is waiting to hear from you[staff_note]just a phone call away[/staff_note][/title]

[title="2"]The website design process[/title]
[html]
<div class="float_surrounder company_columns">
	<div class="company_column company_column_first">[/html][title="3"]How do we do it?[/title]

Take a look inside our usual full-agency website design process [sup]*3[/sup]:
[semihtml]{$CSS_INCLUDE,lightbox}{$JAVASCRIPT_INCLUDE,javascript_prototype}{$JAVASCRIPT_INCLUDE,javascript_scriptaculous}{$JAVASCRIPT_INCLUDE,javascript_scriptaculous_builder}{$JAVASCRIPT_INCLUDE,javascript_scriptaculous_effects}{$JAVASCRIPT_INCLUDE,javascript_lightbox}<a rel="lightbox" href="{$BASE_URL*}/uploads/website_specific/ocportal.com/process.png"><img alt="Website design process" src="{$BASE_URL*}/uploads/website_specific/ocportal.com/process_thumb.png" /></a>[/semihtml][surround="associated_details"](click the diagram for a larger version)[/surround]

The process begins with you submitting your requirements. There is no &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo;: every web solution we do is written to the needs of that customer. We work to agree on a website development plan with a fixed-price quote, then submit diagrams and screen designs for approval.

After you sign-off, our website development begins. This phase includes regular progress updates plus thorough testing where we critically review our work against [tooltip="This includes aesthetics, interaction design, information architecture / 
layout, compatibility, usability, SEO, web standards, and accessibility"]a wide range of quality and standards compliance criteria[/tooltip]. Then we prepare a live demo for you to evaluate.
[html]	</div>

	<div class="company_column company_column_mid">[/html]
When everyone is happy, we deploy the new website, and remain on-call for further support needs with our [i]Experts by the Hour[/i] service.
	
[title="3"]What do we charge?[/title]

For all full-agency developments, we charge our standard hourly rates which incorporate all our development costs. Currently:[semihtml]
<ul>
<li>[b]Web designer[/b]<br />
[currency="GBP" bracket="1"]40[/currency] per hour.</li>
<li>[b]Web developer[/b]<br />
[currency="GBP" bracket="1"]60[/currency] per hour.</li>
<li>[b]Project manager[/b]<br />
[currency="GBP" bracket="1"]40[/currency] per hour.</li>
</ul>[/semihtml]
Prices typically start from about [currency="GBP" bracket="1"]2500[/currency] for a professionally designed website, with [currency="GBP" bracket="1"]10000[/currency] being a typical amount for a website with a lot of awesome-new functionality.

You will receive your initial quote once we have identified your particular needs.

[html]	</div>

	<div class="company_column company_column_last">[/html][title="3"]What to provide us[/title]

It is best if you can provide detailed specifications to design for, because it reduces the risk of misunderstanding and things go much more quickly. Examples:
 - Website objectives
 - Feature lists for development
 - Sketches of how screens should look (if you have strong ideas in this area)
 - Descriptions of behaviour
If you are too busy for this, or are not sure how to write a good web brief/specification then our [page="site:quiz:do:project_briefing"]project briefing survey[/page] provides a strong start.

If new requirements come up after the initial sign-off, they may have to be incorporated into your web development at a later stage. Such revisions usually involve a change to the quote, as well. This is why we try and work things out ahead of time and carefully match your requirements and budget.

[title="2"]Comparison to other web designers - don't get ripped off![/title]

[img="Be wary of web design companies" float="right"]{$IMG,bullets/warn}[/img]A lot (possibly the majority) of companies cut-corners and generally do a shoddy web design job. We've put together a document explaining [url="what to look out for"]{$BASE_URL}/uploads/website_specific/ocportal.com/web-client-guide.pdf[/url] and another on [url="pricing"]{$BASE_URL}/uploads/website_specific/ocportal.com/pricing.pdf[/url]. We're upfront about our costs, most web design companies advertise their lowest quotes but have their highest-budget projects in their portfolio.

[title="3"]Don't be fooled by a slick pitch[/title]

[img="Plan your web development funding" float="right"]{$IMG,bullets/plan}[/img]There isn't much meaning to 'accreditation' logos, and some companies are known to get good testimonials by giving out freebies. Here are some demonstrable facts about ocProducts:
 - [url="http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/hiphop-for-php-six-months-later/416880943919"]Thanked publicly by Facebook[/url] for helping them improve their technology
 - One of just a few Content Management Systems [url="distributed by Microsoft"]http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/ocportal.aspx[/url]
 - [page="site:members"]Thousands of registered users[/page] of our technology
 - [url="Regular third-party coverage"]http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site:cmsreport.com+ocportal[/url] of our innovations
 - [url="http://bitnami.org/stack/ocportal"]Third parties package our technology[/url] for use on cutting-edge Amazon Cloud services
 - We are rated highest by users for &lsquo;Built-in Applications&rsquo; on the [url="biggest CMS comparison website"]http://www.cmsmatrix.org/[/url]
 - A high percentage of web hosts supply our technology as a service to their users
Local web designers may make a lot of bold fancy claims about expertise and technology, and have a few nice sites in their portfolio, but can they say anything like this? ocProducts is an International technology leader, but with all the business and creative excellence you'd want from a good web design company burning at our core.

[size="0.9"](if another company says they have a CMS, can you actually demo it? Usually it is either something they've knocked together, or they simply claim something like Joomla or Wordpress as their own)[/size]

[title="2"]Agency or support ticket?[/title]

[img="Full service agency, with direct project managers contacts, or online support tickets?" float="right"]{$IMG,bullets/support2}[/img]This page of our website relates to our agency service. We also have a support tickets system called &ldquo;Experts By The Hour&rdquo; that is available to you. This is our innovative service for providing great web support at whatever service level you require for an individual query -- saving you money for small queries, and meeting urgency when needed (and no long-term service contract!). We have a [url="document that helps you decide"]{$BASE_URL}/uploads/website_specific/ocportal.com/agency-vs-support-ticket.pdf[/url] whether to choose our agency service or support tickets.

We usually recommend that large developments be done via our agency service (for example, a complete website design), then supported using a topped-up &ldquo;Experts By The Hour&rdquo; account. The agency service has many advantages: for example we can meet in person [sup]*4[/sup].

[semihtml]<div style="width: 231px; margin-left: 10px" class="right">[block="10" blogs="1" title="Our CEO's blog" filter="17"]side_news[/block]</div>[/semihtml][title="2"]Project funding[/title]

There are roughly three kinds of web design project funding scenarios:
1) New businesses, designed to make money with the website being the/a key foundation
2) A necessary investment for a new/existing business (a capital cost to &ldquo;keep with the times&rdquo;)
3) A non-profit project, such as for a charity or government organisation who need a strong web presence
Sometimes we see web design project ideas that we don't immediately see as viable as the foundation for a business. We try and do some level of market review when we write a project proposal, to identify competition, learn a little about the markets involved, and see what has sometimes not worked for other businesses in the past. We may make some suggestions on how to add additional differentiation to your original idea, or what marketing strategies you could use to reach your market.

Ultimately though it is important that you yourself consider your business plan carefully as there is quite a lot of expense and uncertainty starting a web design project on the modern web. If you'd like us to conduct a more thorough and formal review on your behalf please ask us to do so and we'll include that as an initial phase of the project.

Generally a business should see a website development investment like any other: write a proper business plan, then arrange an appropriate source of funding (for example it might be a personal investment, a company expenditure, or from an external business investor).

					<h3>How do we do it?</h3>

					<p>Take a look inside our usual full-agency website design process *3:</p>

					<p>The process begins with you submitting your requirements. There is no "one size fits all": every web solution we do is written to the needs of that customer. We work to agree on a website development plan with a fixed-price quote, then submit diagrams and screen designs for approval.</p>

					<p>After you sign-off, our website development begins. This phase includes regular progress updates plus thorough testing where we critically review our work against a wide range of quality and standards compliance criteria. Then we prepare a live demo for you to evaluate.</p>

					<p>When everyone is happy, we deploy the new website, and remain on-call for further support needs with our professional support service.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="tabscontent" id="contentz2">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<h3>What do we charge?</h3>

				<p>For all full-agency developments, we charge our standard hourly rates which incorporate all our development costs. Currently:</p>

				<p><strong>Web designer:</strong> <span class="highLt">£40 GBP</span> per hour.<br />
				<strong>Web developer:</strong> <span class="highLt">£60 GBP</span> per hour.<br />
				<strong>Project manager:</strong><span class="highLt">£40 GBP</span> per hour.</p>

				<p>Prices typically start from about £2,500 GBP for a professionally designed website, with £10,000 GBP being a typical amount for a website with a lot of awesome-new functionality.</p>

				<p>You will receive your initial quote once we have identified your particular needs.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="tabscontent" id="contentz3">
				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<h3>What to provide us</h3>

				<p>It is best if you can provide detailed specifications to design for, because it reduces the risk of misunderstanding and things go much more quickly.</p>

				<p>Examples:</p>

				<p>&bull; Website objectives<br />
				&bull; Feature lists for development<br />
				&bull; Sketches of how screens should look (if you have strong ideas in this area)<br />
				&bull; Descriptions of behaviour</p>

			<div class="sept"></div>

			<p>As well as being able to provide a high quality agency service, we enjoy working on web design projects with other professionals in partnership. For example, we can work with designers as a development provider &ndash; making the design and vision real, and implementing extreme technology as required. If you would like to work with us then [page="_SEARCH:tickets:ticket:ticket_type=Partnership"]we would love to hear from you[/page].</p>

			<div class="sept"></div>

			<p>We don't do Flash websites. We work to [url="W3C standards"]http://www.w3.org/standards/[/url] (the proper standards for consistent reliable accessible web-sites), and Flash isn't one of these. Flash won't work on iPads or iPhones, hurts search result positions, and is considered by some a 'rogue' tool in web-design. Modern websites can still be very flashy without needing Adobe Flash. Where it is needed (usually, for online games) we'll partner up with a specialist.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>*1 &ndash; sometimes we'll put you in touch with one of our partner companies to provide your solution, in which case your business relationship and the project responsibility would be with this partner company and not ocProducts. These companies are chosen by ocProducts due to their experience of Composr, their established working relationship with the developers, and their experience running projects. They will often subcontract the most technical work back to ocProducts. We do this so we can focus on continuing to develop the world-class Composr technology, and because ocProducts doesn't always have the free staff capacity to run large projects when other trusted companies do. Also sometimes other experienced companies are better placed geographically to lead a project.</p>

	<p>*2 &ndash; this is usually the case, but some projects may differ. The negotiated project scope takes precedence over what is discussed on this page.</p>

	<p>*3 &ndash; our partner companies may have other processes, or the process may be tuned differently according to the needs of your project. The exact process should be confirmed during initial discussions.</p>

	<p>*4 &ndash; for longer distance travel, we will usually need to charge for travel time and costs</p>

	<p>*5 &ndash; if taking a quote would take a long time, we may give a price range indication while seeking to confirm you have a realistic budget, after which we'll produce a more accurate quote</p>
