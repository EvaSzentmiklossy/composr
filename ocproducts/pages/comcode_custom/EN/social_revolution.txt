[title sub="To reach the next level of social integration &ndash; and the next level of business success"]Extending beyond websites[/title]

The internet is becoming a more connected place with Social Networks fundamental to the every day life of many users (especially amongst key youth demographics). They have become an unparalleled communication tool to reach out to your business's target audience. 

This means is that you, as a business or website owner, may want to go further to make yourself heard above your competitors. 

Composr is an ideal CMS for a community based website but even Composr's extensive features can't cover every possibility of future social app. Fortunately our team has all the skills you need to extend your website's reach beyond the traditional website and immerse your reach deep into the world of Social Media. 

Every website has different needs and requirements and below are a few powerful ways in which we can help you dramatically extend the reach of your website:

[title="2"]Syndication of staff content[/title]
[img float="right"]{$IMG,social/twitter}[/img]
In some cases you may just require syndication of your news and admin added content to your Facebook page or Twitter account.

Although this is only a minor development we can tailor for you which content is syndicated across the marketing channels that are important to your demographic.

[title="2"]Facebook Connect[/title]
[img float="right"]{$IMG,social/facebook}[/img]
We can add Facebook Connect to your site, to let your user's log into your site using their Facebook account. Once this is available it opens the possibility for your users to share their own user generated content from your website directly on to Facebook quickly and easily.

By syndicating user generated content you are extending your reach and increasing the number of incoming links into your site. We can create custom functionality which we can individually tailor to your needs.

[title="2"]Facebook Apps[/title]

We can create a customised app to run on top of Facebook, advertising your brand and potentially directing your user's friends to your website. Automatic referrals!

We believe every website has unique needs and no standard app will ever cover all of these needs fully. A unique Facebook App is important to your unique identity.

Facebook includes a large well-connected user-base who primarily want to have fun and aren't feeling rushed. Placing something fun or interesting on Facebook is the best way to go viral with your brand.

[title="2"]Mobile Apps[/title]

We can create Mobile apps for Android and iPhone, which like our Facebook applications, will be individually tailored for your business.

[img float="left"]{$IMG,social/android}[/img]While some CMSs have prebuilt Mobile phone apps already available on App Stores, we don't believe that your users should have to interact with a generic gatekeeper app in order to reach your brand, nor should your mobile functionality be a clone of everybody else's. Let us make you a unique app.

The benefits of an App include a more responsive feel compared to a simple mobile version of your site, and your inclusion in App Stores.
