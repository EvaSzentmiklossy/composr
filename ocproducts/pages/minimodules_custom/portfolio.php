These functions include members only access, forums, galleries, newsletters, event calendars and online payments. Throughout the project ocProducts demonstrated a high degree of professionalism and great technical expertise. Its highly co-operative approach and prompt response to suggestions has contributed greatly to a superb website tailored to our needs.\n\nThis initial phase of development was completed within our own fairly relaxed timescale and to a fixed-price budget. The website is moderated and maintained on a day to day basis by ourselves using Composr with ocProducts providing second line support when required. We intend to use ocProducts for any major enhancements in the future.&rdquo; Chris Clarke -- Web Director -- The Warsash Association\n\n&ldquo;The diligent manner in which you provide constructive technical advice has been most helpful and the cooperation and close attention your company has given to our needs, exemplary. We are delighted with the end product and consider this to represent very good value.\n\nThe website has enabled our association to consolidate its widespread membership, bringing together many members who have been out of touch for decades. It has also proved to be a most valuable and productive recruiting tool.&rdquo; Commodore AD Barrett -- President of the Warsash association.",
