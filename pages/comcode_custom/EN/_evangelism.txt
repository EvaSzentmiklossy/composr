There are three "CMS's" that get all the coverage nowadays: Joomla, Drupal, and Wordpress. This is a virtuous circle for these products -- coverage leads to further coverage, and it's up-up-up -- but it's a vicious circle for other deserving projects, because the louder the coverage for competitors, the harder it is for the rest of us to get attention.

I'm not going to try and convince anybody here that Composr can run circles around our competitors. You can see the difference is like "night and day" with your own eyes from our feature page, from the docs, from our comparison page, from trying it out, and from the constant glowing reviews we get on our own forums from people who tried everything then found Composr (formerly ocPortal). Modern history is full of examples of superior products that became eclipsed for one reason or another, it happens all the time unfortunately.

What we am doing here is showing how [b]you[/b] can do something very quick that will really help give back to the community, and help us grow. If Composr user's club together and make their voices heard each time someone omits Composr from a review of CMS's we can set things right. Reviewer's usually aren't intentionally missing us out, it's just they themselves find out about other products from other review's or recommendation's!

We don't need to match the popularity of big CMSs to be successful. Unlike most projects, we already have a sustainable model and are constantly growing. But by increasing our exposure we can grow faster.

In this topic moderators will post/emphasise links to place's where Composr deserves to be but is missing. What we'd like you to do is to make your voice heard on each occasion we make a post. Maybe this means e-mailing an author, or maybe it means posting a comment. Whatever it involves please bear in mind that we want to enlighten people not spam them -- so [b]it is critical that you don't just make the same points someone else has already made there[/b].

Everybody who takes the golden opportunities in this topic to spread-the-word about Composr is morally entitled to join the 'Composr supporters' usergroup (anyone can join regardless, it's an honour system). Through this usergroup you get an increased quota of gift points!

So:
1) Take one of our opportunities to spread-the-word about Composr, and make some people see the light ([b]without spamming or being rude[/b])!
2) Go to the [semihtml]<a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,site:groups:view:{$FIND_ID_VIA_LABEL,group,Composr supporters}}">Composr supporter usergroup</a>[/semihtml] and apply to join!
3) If you'd like to keep helping, set notifications on this topic.


If you'd like to tell the world that [i]you[/i] rock (for supporting us), or if you've found another 'disgraceful' example of someone overlooking Composr in a batch review/recommendation, then please reply showing the case.
