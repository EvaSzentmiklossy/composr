# Config
CONFIG_CATEGORY_ECOMMERCE=eCommerce options
CONFIG_CATEGORY_DESCRIPTION__ECOMMERCE=The eCommerce system provides usergroup subscription support, but is also a wider system that programmers may leverage for other purposes. Note the eCommerce system is not designed for online &ldquo;shopping cart&rdquo;-style stores.

PAYMENT_GATEWAY_PASSWORD=Gateway password
CONFIG_OPTION_payment_gateway_password=The password used for the payment gateway account where payments will be received.

CONFIG_OPTION_payment_gateway_callback_password=If your payment gateway requires a special password for confirmation of callbacks, please specify it here. This is not required for PayPal.
PAYMENT_GATEWAY_VPN_PASSWORD=Gateway VPN password

PAYMENT_GATEWAY=Payment gateway

CREDIT_CARD_CLEANUP_DAYS=Credit card cleanup days
