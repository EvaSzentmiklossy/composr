DOC_ACTIONLOG=The action log will allow you to trace what actions have been performed on the site; and where given, the reasons for doing them. This log gives a combined view of submission, administration, and moderation actions, and provides integration with the tracing and IP banning modules, as well as submitter banning of its own.
DOC_ACTIONLOG_BAN_HELP=This screen to find information relating to a website user. It's purpose is as a hub for information, and does not provide any information that is not also available elsewhere in the software. The primary screen for managing a joined member is the member's profile screen.\n\nThe software has tried to pull together as much as it can, by trying to match against the triad of [b]IP address[/b], [b]member ID[/b], and [b]username[/b]/[b]author[/b]. Links are provided that correspond to each of these, each link providing a different perspective on what is likely a single user.\n\nIf you would like to ban the member, it is advised that this be done through their member profile. If you would like to provide a more low-level ban against IP address, note down their IP address groups and then proceed to the [url="IP ban"]{1}[/url] screen. Before proceeding though, it is advisable to carefully research the usages of each IP address set by performing additional IP-based lookups (following the IP addresses as linked will lead you to the appropriate screens).
