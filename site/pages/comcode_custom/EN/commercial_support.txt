						<h2>Technical support</h2>

						<p>From advice on how best to use Composr for your needs, to questions about website deployment in general, you can count on our knowledgeable, friendly staff to be the support team you can depend on.</p>

						<h3>Here are some examples of ways we can help:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Answering Composr-related questions (mentoring, and advice).</li>
							<li>Help configuring complex features, such as LDAP or eCommerce support.</li>
							<li>Availability to repair errors (e.g. if a database corrupts due to a power outage).</li>
							<li>Advice and tutoring on web technologies, such as CSS.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Sound like the kinds of things you'd prefer not to think about? No problem -- we've been doing this for years.</p>

						<div class="commonBtn margin-l-20">
							<a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,_SEARCH:contact:support}">Ask your question</a>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h2>Installation services</h2>

						<p>We can install Composr onto your server of choice.</p>

						<p>If you would like our installation service please first check:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Make sure you have at least 8 credits.</li>
							<li>You agree to our [page="site:server_access"]server access policy[/page].</li>
							<li>Your server meets our minimum requirements (if we can't install because it doesn't, or the server is faulty, we'll still need to charge for the service).</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="commonBtn margin-l-20">
							<a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,_SEARCH:contact:installation}">Send us your details</a>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h2>Upgrade service</h2>

                        <p>Want an existing Composr website upgraded to a newer version?</p>

                        <p>We can handle:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Uploading the new files.</li>
							<li>Upgrading your database.</li>
							<li>Updating your theme.</li>
							<li>Updating any custom code.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="commonBtn margin-l-20">
							<a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,_SEARCH:contact:upgrade}">Brief us</a>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h2>Staff secondment</h2>

						<p>The best modern websites involve ongoing work to keep them fresh, and optimise the user experience. We can arrange for developer(s) to work regular hours for you.</p>

						<h3>Benefits:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Pay only for the regular hours you need rather than a full salary</li>
							<li>Achieve excellence</li>
							<li>Save the time of having to micro-manage ongoing maintenance, just rely on us and pay the regular invoices</li>
							<li>Avoid having to interview people for a role you are not yourself expert in</li>
							<li>Avoid the need for office space</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="commonBtn margin-l-20">
							<a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,_SEARCH:contact:support}">Talk to us</a>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h2>Feature sponsorship</h2>

						<p>Composr moves forward when people sponsor new functionality, or when new functionality is developed as part of a wider commercial project. If you want to see something integrated cleanly into Composr's roadmap, and don't need a custom deployment, feature sponsorship is a great way to do it.</p>

						<p>Sponsored features are developed at ocProduct's lowest hourly rate (budget priority) and sponsorship is accepted for most things that make sense to be included in the Composr project. There is no definite time window in which sponsored work is completed, but we don't like to see things queue up. When the work is complete it will be committed into the development repository. A patch is also supplied for the latest stable version &ndash; although these won't be maintained routinely so you may also need some support to have the patch maintained until it lands as a standard feature.</p>

						<p><a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,site:tracker}">Visit the tracker</a> to declare your sponsorship. Once you have sponsored something you will be given the ability to buy support credits in precise quantities (we only offer this to feature sponsorers, as buying individual credits isn't an appropriate model for normal technical support).</p>

						<p>If you just want to support the project, we can help you pick something to sponsor, so just open up a ticket with us and let us know.</p>
