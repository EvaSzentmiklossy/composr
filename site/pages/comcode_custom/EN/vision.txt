	</div>

	<div class="cntRow">
		<p>Composr isn't just thrown together on a whim. It is developed to a very particular vision, which we describe below in the 10 point manifesto:</p>

		<div class="vision-list">
			<ul>
				<li>
					A Composr website should excel at more than just article publishing. Nobody should have to rely on non-standard addons to achieve common website functionality &ndash; conversely, feature must be easily justifiable and software bloat avoided.
				</li>

				<li>
					Features should almost always be designed for users not developers.<br />Developers should also be supported in achieving their optimal productivity.
				</li>

				<li>
					A CMS should embody and reflect web standards: it is a tool for building for the mechanisms we define in our standards; standards&nbsp;and&nbsp;tools are other sides of the same coin.
				</li>

				<li>
					Everything should fit together smoothly, into a tidy streamlined model:<br />From the features running through the software, to the clean design of the Composr website.
				</li>

				<li>
					Composr should remain Open Source software, free to download, install, and modify.<br />
					Openness fosters innovation throughout all the corners of society.
				</li>

				<li>
					Everything should be as documented and user-friendly as possible &ndash; any area where this can't be done inside the development process should be made achievable by a well-integrated crowd-sourcing mechanism.
				</li>

				<li>
					Composr is here to empower everybody, from casual users, to programmers, to web managers.<br />People in every country of the world.
				</li>

				<li>
					Composr users should be encouraged to give back to the Composr project in what ways they can, to ensure Composr continues to push forward unencumbered by external influences &ndash; and contributors should be given the credit they deserve for the efforts they put in.
				</li>

				<li>
					Composr development should not be guided by short-term fads, or reinventions of the wheel.<br />Composr should not be biased in its affiliation with third party companies.
				</li>

				<li>
					Everything in Composr should be done to best standards, and fully flexible and customisable.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2 class="sub-head-big">Standards &amp; accessibility</h2>

		<p>One key factor we emphasise is the growing importance of accessibility on the Internet. For the web to progress, we all (website developers) share the obligation to build semantically-correct websites. This essential consideration ensures that innovative new software can interact with websites in clever ways, and that everyone-including paralysed and blind users, can fully participate on the web.</p>

		<p>Sadly, widespread support is largely lacking within the CMS industry. Composr, contrast currently conforms to <a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,docs:tut_markup}">dozens of strict standards</a> &mdash; something for which we are very proud.</p>
