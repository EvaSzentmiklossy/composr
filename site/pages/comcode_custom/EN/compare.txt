				<li>We've been around since 2004 and has evolved continuously to keep up to date with technological changes</li>
				<li>Composr has an active community of users.</li>
				<li>Composr has a proper company behind it, so you can trust that the developers won't vanish. Lack of reliance on addons = no risk of orphaned features</li>
				<li>The team behind Composr have a professional support service available to you if you need it</li>
				<li>Because Composr is deployed commercially, it is continually tuned</li>
				<li>Through Composr's advanced theme technology you can get a unique design up quickly</li>
				<li>You can integrate Composr with most forum software, so that forum users may login to the site</li>
				<li>Composr is a real hotbed of innovation, with many features not found anywhere else</li>

		<li>This data was taken from <a href="http://www.cmsmatrix.org/" target="_blank">CMS Matrix</a>, tests run default installs, and our understanding of the systems.<br />Please [page=":contact:free"]notify us[/page] if the status of anything is incorrect and we'll update the table.</li>
		<li>*1: Most of this functionality can be added to other systems using third-party plugins (we explain why we think this is bad above).<br />The features we picked for the table are just some examples: we didn't want to make the table hundreds of rows long.</li>
		<li>*2: We could have improved our speed by removing bundled addons (this gets Composr 17.77 trans/sec), but we wanted to be consistent in comparing default installations. Drupal 7's default site did not come with any content or blocks placed, so was naturally very fast. Wordpress is simple without much overhead.<br />These figures are outdated and need updating. We have managed to do some quite sophisticated optimisations in Composr v10.</li>
