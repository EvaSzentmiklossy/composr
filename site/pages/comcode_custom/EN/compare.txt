				<li>Composr can be thoroughly customised &ndash; you can do a surprising amount without a programmer</li>
				<li>Use the integrated administration system: everything is neatly organised in harmony. Because Composr is developed by a dedicated team, everything is designed for simplicity and coherence</li>
				<li>Composr has many 100s of pages of docs freely available, plus video tutorials. Because you don't need 3rd party addons, you can find all support and documentation in one place</li>
				<li>We've been around since 2004 and has evolved continuously to keep up to date with technological changes</li>
				<li>Composr has an active community of users.</li>
				<li>Composr has a proper company behind it, so you can trust that the developers won't vanish. Lack of reliance on addons = no risk of orphaned features</li>
				<li>The team behind Composr have a professional support service available to you if you need it</li>
				<li>Because Composr is deployed commercially, it is continually tuned</li>
				<li>Through Composr's advanced theme technology you can get a unique design up quickly</li>
				<li>You can integrate Composr with most forum software, so that forum users may login to the site</li>
				<li>Composr is a real hotbed of innovation, with many features not found anywhere else</li>
				<li>Composr runs on almost any PHP web server &ndash; there are no special software or hardware requirements</li>

[*]the developers expect you to 'fix it yourself', or quite possibly, the developers have disappeared leaving the project stagnant
[*]the developers greet suggestions with fury: they don't get paid, and don't tolerate negative feedback for their efforts. Features are added on developer whim, rather than according to a plan that benefits the end users
[*]whilst the developers are happy to code for free, they will not do the dull stuff like write documentation, or design user-friendly interfaces[/list]
