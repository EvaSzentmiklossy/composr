[title]Composr demo[/title]

To set up your personal demo we just need a few details from you:
 - A name for the demo which we'll use in your temporary URL.
 - Your email address (so emails on the demo go to you, and so we can keep in contact).
 - A password for you to log in to the demo with.

Please note that this is a demo system, your demo will only last a few days. Composr is free, but you will need to find a web host.

[box="Shared demo: OpenSourceCMS" type="light"]
If you'd prefer to avoid entering the details required to set up your own demo you can also use the [url="OpenSourceCMS demo"]http://www.opensourcecms.com/demo/1/194/Composr[/url].
Log in with the username 'admin' and the password 'demo123' (*).

If you ever receive an error about a missing page or file, it is probably because the demo is in the process of automatically being reset. Wait a moment and try again.
