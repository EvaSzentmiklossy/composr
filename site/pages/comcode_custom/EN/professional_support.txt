				[title]Professional Support[/title]

				<p>
					Need help with your Composr website? Head straight to the source with our professional service.<br />
					Our experienced team can help in almost any situation (examples included under support types).
				</p>

				<p>
					With our pre-pay system you purchase credits in advance, then maximise their value depending on the priority of your needs. All work is done within tickets (apart from secondment, which is flexible).
				</p>

				<p>
					We are able to pass on savings by avoiding the need to manage invoicing etc for every small job.
				</p>

				<p>
					As a thank you for supporting the Composr developers, each purchased support credit automatically leads to 50 points (so you get a position of respect in the Composr community).
				</p>

		<p>&dagger; Response times aren't guaranteed, but if we miss a regular response time we will charge it at the back-burner rate. If you expect to be putting in tickets that will require an hour or more a day over an extended period of days, it is a good idea to arrange a staff secondment with us.</p>
