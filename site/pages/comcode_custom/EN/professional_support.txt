			[title]Professional Support[/title]

			<p>Need help with your Composr website? Head straight to the source with our professional support service.</p>

			<p>Our experienced team can dig you out of any situation: from installation, to routine maintenance and training, or even new programming to give your site the competitive edge.</p>

			<p>With our pre-pay system you purchase credits in advance, then maximise their value depending on the priority of your needs. We are able to pass on savings by avoiding the need to manage invoicing and take separate payment for every small job.</p>

					<li>
						<h2>Technical support</h2>

						<p>From advice on how best to use Composr for your needs, to questions about website deployment in general, you can count on our knowledgeable, friendly staff to be the support team you can depend on.</p>

						<h3>Here are some examples of ways we can help:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Answering Composr-related questions (mentoring, and advice).</li>
							<li>Help configuring complex features, such as LDAP or eCommerce support.</li>
							<li>Availability to repair errors (e.g. if a database corrupts due to a power outage).</li>
							<li>Advice and tutoring on web technologies, such as CSS.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Sound like the kinds of things you'd prefer not to think about? No problem -- we've been doing this for years.</p>

						<div class="commonBtn margin-l-20">
							<a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,_SEARCH:contact:support}">Ask your question</a>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h2>Installation services</h2>

						<p>We can install Composr onto your server of choice.</p>

						<p>If you would like our installation service please first check:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Make sure you have at least 8 credits.</li>
							<li>You agree to our [page="site:server_access"]server access policy[/page].</li>
							<li>Your server meets our minimum requirements (if we can't install because it doesn't, or the server is faulty, we'll still need to charge for the service).</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="commonBtn margin-l-20">
							<a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,_SEARCH:contact:installation}">Send us your details</a>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h2>Upgrade service</h2>

						<p>Want an existing Composr website upgraded to a newer version?</p>

						<p>We can handle:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Uploading the new files.</li>
							<li>Upgrading your database.</li>
							<li>Updating your theme.</li>
							<li>Updating any custom code.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="commonBtn margin-l-20">

						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h2>Staff secondment</h2>

						<p>The best modern websites involve ongoing work to keep them fresh, and optimise the user experience. We can arrange for developer(s) to work regular hours for you.</p>

						<h3>Benefits:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Pay only for the regular hours you need rather than a full salary</li>
							<li>Achieve excellence</li>
							<li>Save the time of having to micro-manage ongoing maintenance, just rely on us and pay the regular invoices</li>
							<li>Avoid having to interview people for a role you are not yourself expert in</li>
							<li>Avoid the need for office space</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="commonBtn margin-l-20">
							<a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,_SEARCH:contact:secondment}">Talk to us</a>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						<h2>Feature sponsorship</h2>

						<p>Composr moves forward when people sponsor new functionality. If you want to see something integrated cleanly into Composr's roadmap, feature sponsorship might be a great way to do it.</p>

						<p>If you just want to support the project, we can help you pick something to sponsor, so just open up a ticket with us and let us know.</p>

						<div class="commonBtn margin-l-20">
