	<li>You can remove any features you don't need: we hate bloat too, and believe in simplicity</li>

	<li>Use our framework to extend and override code without having to compromise upgradability</li>
	<li>Our CEO is a programmer and our creative director's father co-invented Usenet &ndash; we live tech</li>

	<li>We design for scalability &ndash; with support for Rackspace Cloud Sites and Facebook's HipHop PHP</li>
	<li>There's no need for third party plugins to get a decent feature-base (compare our features!)</li>
	<li>Our high standards span all our features; for example cross-feature proxy-server support</li>
	<li>Our system architecture allows cross-feature functionality such as points and unified search</li>
	<li>Technology is used consistently &ndash; e.g. you only need to work with one templating system</li>
	<li>We find and fix bugs remarkably quickly, usually within just a couple of working days</li>
	<li>Everything we do is free and online: no need to invest in extra books or commercial addons</li>
