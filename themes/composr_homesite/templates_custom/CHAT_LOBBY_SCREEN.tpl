<p>You can chat here with other Composr users using your compo.sr username ({$USERNAME*}) or you can chat from inside your own website using your website name.</p>

<p>Be advised you may be better off <a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,forum:}">posting in the forum</a> if there is no one here to answer you immediately or if your question is quite long and complex. If you really need an answer you should consider professional support, as otherwise you're relying on volunteers.</p>

	Our goal is to make it really easy to talk to other Composr users to help each other.<br /><br />
	Want to help out by hanging out here longer-term? Set up an IRC client to automatically connect to the Freenode #composrcms channel.<br /><br />
	Questions only get answered if people like you are here to answer them and/or to set an example.
