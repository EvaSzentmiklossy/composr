<p>You can chat here with other Composr users using your compo.sr username ({$USERNAME*}) or you can chat from inside your own website using your website name.</p>

<p>Be advised you may be better off <a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,forum:}">posting in the forum</a> if there is no one here to answer you immediately or if your question is quite long and complex. If you really need a quick and detailed answer you might consider commercial support, as the chat and forum are run by volunteers.</p>

<p>Please note that <kbd>chris_graham</kbd> will always show as online in the room, due to the way this Zoho Chat room works. The real Chris pops in occasionally but tends to be horrifically busy.</p>

	Our goal is to make it really easy to talk to other Composr users to help each other.<br /><br />
	It would be great if everyone could get quick answers here wouldn't it? The power is in your hands to make that happen by setting an example. You could consider setting this page to open up when your web browser starts and answer people's questions as they come in.<br /><br />
	Questions only get answered if people like you are here to answer them. Karma wants users to support users, so that everybody wins {$COMCODE,:)}.
