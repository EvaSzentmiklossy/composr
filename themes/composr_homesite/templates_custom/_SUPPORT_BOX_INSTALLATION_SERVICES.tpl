<h4>If you would like our installation service please first check:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure you have at least 8 credits.</li>
	<li>You agree to our <a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,site:server_access}" target="_blank" title="Server access policy {!LINK_NEW_WINDOW}">server access policy</a>.</li>
	<li>Your server meets our minimum requirements<br />(if we can't install because it doesn't, or if the server is faulty, we'll still need to charge for the service).</li>
</ul>
