	<li>We have a rare transparency, even among Open Source companies&hellip; We don't hide our support prices, and think it is bad spirit for an OSS product to have a paid "pro" version</li>
	<li>Every little bit of HTML and CSS can be customised in Composr without having to ever touch PHP</li>
	<li>Our powerful templating language allows you to do common things like zebra stripes easily</li>
	<li>Composr lets you make the system completely White Label with just a few clicks, for free</li>
	<li>Your clients likely ask for lots of features: compare us on <a href="http://www.cmsmatrix.org/matrix/cms-matrix/ocportal" target="_blank">CMS Matrix</a>, we dare you!<!--TODO: fix link when possible--></li>
	<li>We obsess about W3C compliance: see our <a href="{$PAGE_LINK*,site:vision}" target="_blank">vision page</a> to see how far we go</li>
	<li>We care about clean design: see how we cut out the noise on our website compared to other CMSs</li>
	<li>A single Composr site can have multiple designs &ndash; e.g. different branding on different sections</li>
	<li>Avoid wrestling with the design styles of a dozen addon designers: use our consistent base.<br />Features are tame and built without ego &ndash; unlike third party addons other CMSs rely on</li>
	<li>Our CEO used to work for top brands, at a design agency: we live what you need and expect</li>
	<li>All kind of effects are built into Comcode, such as carousels, tooltips, tabs, and sliders</li>
	<li>As you know, clients now demand a CMS; Composr is designed for use by non-techies</li>
	<li>With Composr you can create a platform for your client that can grow with their business &ndash; turn on new features as you/they need them</li>
</ul>
