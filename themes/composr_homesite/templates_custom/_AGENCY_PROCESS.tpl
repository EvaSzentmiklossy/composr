<p>The process begins with you submitting your requirements. There is no "one size fits all": every web solution we do is written to the needs of that customer. We work to agree on a website development plan with either a fixed-price quote or a secondment agreement, then submit diagrams and screen designs for approval.</p>

<p>After you sign-off, our website development begins. This phase includes regular progress updates plus thorough testing where we critically review our work against a wide range of quality and standards compliance criteria. Then we prepare a live demo for you to evaluate.</p>

<p>When everyone is happy, we deploy the new website, and remain on-call for further support needs with our professional support or secondment services.</p>
