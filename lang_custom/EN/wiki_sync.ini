[strings]
WIKI_SYNC_MEDIA_DIRECTORY=Media directory to sync to
CONFIG_OPTION_wiki_sync_media_directory=Attachments will be converted to simple media files, and stored in this directory (if non-blank).
WIKI_SYNC_PAGE_DIRECTORY=Page directory to sync to
CONFIG_OPTION_wiki_sync_page_directory=Wiki+ pages will be converted to simple text files (the same format as Comcode pages), and stored in this directory (if non-blank).
WIKI_ALT_CHANGES_LINK_STUB=Changes link stub
CONFIG_OPTION_wiki_alt_changes_link_stub=Instead of using the internal Wiki+ change log, link through to the exported page name under this stub URL (if non-blank). Typically you will put in the github history URL at your page directory.
WIKI_ENABLE_WYSIWYG=Enable WYSIWYG
CONFIG_OPTION_wiki_enable_wysiwyg=Allow the WYSIWYG editor to run for Wiki+. You may want to disable it, so that exported Comcode is kept really clean.
WIKI_ENABLE_GIT_SYNC=Sync with git
CONFIG_OPTION_wiki_enable_git_sync=<strong>Advanced</strong> (requires an understanding of basic programming, and git operation). Assume the Media directory and Page directory are both git checkouts, and regularly pull them. When changes are made, do git commits and pushes immediately and automatically. We will assume you have git installed on your server, and the PHP <kbd>shell_exec</kbd> function can work, and the <kbd>git init</kbd> commands were done initially under the webserver user.
NOTIFICATION_TYPE_wiki_failed_git_pull=Failed Wiki+ git pull
