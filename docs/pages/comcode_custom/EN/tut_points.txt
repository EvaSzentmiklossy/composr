There are many ways to earn points in Composr. You may not wish to tell your members the precise details for these, in order to avoid abuse and unbalanced member activity, although of course they could educate themselves by reading this tutorial.

Methods of earning points include:
 - Joining
 - Voting in a poll
 - Rating content
 - Poll chosen
 - Submitting various forms of content
 - Length of membership
 - Visiting the site
 - Posting on the forum
 - Entering/passing quizzes
 - Being given them (this is described in a later section)
 - Earning them from selling a download (this is described in a later section)

Most methods of earning points may be altered in the configuration (Admin Zone > Setup > Configuration > Points options), so that the number of points earned from various activities is appropriate for your website.

There is a distinction between the point count for points available for spending, and the point count for the total points ever earned (which contributes to rank and leader-board position). This will usually be made clear, but sometimes circumstance will dictate what is the appropriate meaning.

[title="3"]A note about how points are calculated (somewhat advanced)[/title]

[media float="right" thumb="0" framed="0"]data_custom/images/docs/remember.png[/media]
The number of points a member has is not stored in any place, so is not directly editable. Instead, a members points is dynamically calculated, according to various statistics. You may alter the number of points a member has by viewing their points profile and using either the 'charge' or 'give' features (both of which accept negative values if you are a member of staff). For example, you can charge a member points by charging them a positive number of points, or giving them a negative number (a negative gift would usually be used to reverse a gift that you thought should not have happened). Likewise, you can give a member points by giving them a positive number, or charging them a negative number of points (a negative charge would usually be used to provide a refund).

The reason points are calculated in this way is that the forum driver system means that Composr has no way of determining when a member makes a forum post (the forum does not tell Composr, as it is often a third-party piece of software).

The main ramification of this is that if posts are deleted, the point count goes backwards for the members with deleted posts: we consider this a feature (deleting spam automatically will reverse the point count, at least on robust forums where post count is automatically adjusted upon moderation), and we consider it a bad idea to delete posts from a forum unless they should never have existed. We consider deleting posts the enemy of historical record and the reasons for doing it few, because text generally takes up a trivial amount of space, databases are designed to deal with unconceivable amounts of data, and the topics can be just as easily moved to a hidden archive forum if they are seen as 'getting in the way'.

[title="2"]Gift points[/title]

[media width="150" description="Those who give may get rewarded by the system (this encourages an active community)" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/points_lucky.png[/media]
[concept]Gift points[/concept] allow members to reward each other. Like money can be used to pay someone, so can gift points, based on whatever they value. This economical situation is very important, and essentially capitalism is embodied, such that people go hunting for work that is valued most highly in order to get high returns of points.

Reasons for giving gift points include:
 - Pseudo-payment for a service provided
 - A prize for winning a competition
 - A sign of appreciation for produce a high quality product that benefits the community

Gift points are not exactly like payment, because it doesn't detract from your own point count to give points, it detracts from your gift point count. Members have a quota of gift points, to allocate as they see fit: if they run out, it simply means that they can't give any more for a while.

Gift points are useless unless spent, so the only advantage to hoarding them is to give a large amount in some kind of special situation being awaited; once given, the gift point receiver has the total added to their actual point count. Obviously members could abuse this, by giving points to each other in some form of reciprocal arrangement ("you pat my back I'll pat yours"): this is why there is an admin screen to monitor all gift transactions for fraud (and selectively reverse transactions). You can reach this screen from the Admin Zone > Audit > Gift-point transactions.

[title="2"]Other economy tie-ins[/title]

[title="3"]Buildr (non-bundled)[/title]

Buildr is a very large addon for Composr, made by the developers in a semi-official capacity. It is not included with the main release as it is totally inappropriate for non-community sites, and hence would be consider as 'bloat' (an excessive feature that gets in the way and causes undue complexity and confusion) by most.

Buildr is essentially a game, where members may move in, interact with, and create, a limitless world of rooms, split across multiple themed 'realms'. It can be used to create puzzles, adventures, board games, simulations, and with imagination, many other things.

Points are at the very core of Buildr, and are used in two ways:
1) It costs points (according to a configurable price) to add content to Buildr. Of course, members may try and redeem these points by asking members to give gift points back to them, but this feature prevents abuse and limits the need for moderation.
2) Members may add items to the system, and then sell these items to other members. An example of this being used, is for the controller of a realm used for a 'quest' to add a 'healthy' item into the system: those with more points have a higher chance of surviving to the end of the quest, as they can heal themselves.

The Buildr system is very simple, yet via the small set of options available, presents amazing possibilities.

[title="3"]The real world[/title]

A small number of sites may wish to set up a payment system (outside of the scope of Composr, at the time of writing), to allow members to exchange points for real money, or tangible products or services. Sites that may wish to do this are likely to be sites where the earning of points has a real effect on business goals, such that real-world reimbursement may be appropriate; for example, on a site where members collaborate on art for a published catalogue.

Alternatively, and perhaps more popularly, sites may allow members to exchange real money, for points (again, outside the scope of Composr, at the time of writing). Hence web-masters could earn money from their more enthusiastic members, and those members could elevate themselves on the website.

[title="2"]Rank in Conversr[/title]

[surround]
[media width="150" description="Rank ladder shown in the usergroup directory" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/rank.png[/media]
[media width="150" description="Rank configured when editing a usergroup" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/rank_options.png[/media]
[concept]Conversr[/concept] has a usergroup system that allows automated progression from one usergroup to another, according to point count. This is configured by default such that the usergroup rank images for the usergroups involved imply a rising rank.

The 'status symbol' of rank is an incentive for members to earn points (hence contributing to the site and community), but permissions may also be configured such as to give permission according to rank, simply by assigning the permissions differently for different usergroups.

If you would like to use rank, but not other point features, remove view permissions to the 'points' module and edit the 'Block options' (in the configuration) to not display point details. You cannot remove the points addon if you wish to use ranks.

Note that rank changes are triggered by actions. Someone will not go up in rank based on things like how long they've been a member, until some action (e.g. posting on the forum) triggers a rank recalculation.

[title="2"]The leader-board[/title]

[surround]
[media width="150" description="The points leader-board" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_points/points_leader_board.png[/media]
The leader-board is a block, and corresponding archive viewing module, for the displaying of the top point holders for each week. Like rank, this is another incentive for members to earn points.

The module is the [tt]leader_board[/tt] module ([tt]site:leader_board[/tt] page-link, Social > Leader-board on the default menus).

Please be aware that the leader-board is not entirely accurate, as it actually only calculates the point count of top post count holders, and orders according to this; the reason for this is that, as explained earlier, point count is not actually stored, and calculating it for all members simultaneously would not be efficient. This is unlikely to be noticed, however, because more post count holders are chosen for point calculation than point holders shown, hence a buffer zone exists to reduce the chance of error.

The leader-board is updated and archived weekly, regardless of whether you have the block cache enabled or not.

If you wish to totally reset the leader-board, manually empty the contents of the [tt]leader_board[/tt] database table.

A common point of confusion is users thinking the leader-board shows who are the leaders only over points earned in the particular week. This is not the case, it calculates it based on total points ever, and the weekly updates are to capture snapshots. There is an open tracker issue regarding us also implementing the ability to show activity just for one particular week, but it is technically complex to achieve (it requires a major upheaval) so would need financing via feature sponsorship.
