[title="2"]Getting Composr Mobile SDK[/title]

[title="3"]iOS/Android SDK[/title]

The main SDK can be [url="found on github"]https://github.com/ocproducts/[/url].

[title="3"]Server-side functionality[/title]

To connect to a Composr site you will need to install the non-bundled [tt]composr_mobile_sdk[/tt] addon.
This addon also contains some scripting to help generate app assets from the Composr site.

[title="2"]Notifications[/title]

For iOS notifications to work, put your Apple-provided server certificate over [tt]data_custom/modules/composr_mobile_sdk/ios/server_certificates.pem[/tt] (follow the usual CSR signing process against your Apple developer account).

[title="2"]Toolkit[/title]

The toolkit is a part of the non-bundled [tt]composr_mobile_sdk[/tt] addon.

[title="3"]Language files[/title]

This tool will generate iOS/Android string resources.

It is approximate. For example, it does not handle the data types and pluralisation that [url="Android can support"]http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html[/url] or data types that [url="iOS can support"]https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingResources/Strings/Strings.html[/url].

[list="1"]
[*] Open a command prompt to the Composr installation directory.
[*] Type a command like:
[code="Bash"]
php data_custom/composr_mobile_sdk_build.php language <the .ini filenames which needs to be parsed separated by spaces> <language name>
[/code]
For example, to export the [tt]polls.ini[/tt] and [tt]galleries.ini[/tt] files from the [tt]EN[/tt] language pack:
[code="Bash"]
php data_custom/composr_mobile_sdk_build.php language polls galleries EN
[/code]
[*] Find the files have been generated under [tt]exports/composr_mobile_sdk[/tt]
[*] Copy through to your app, hand-editing as required
[/list]

[title="3"]Image assets[/title]

This tool will export theme images to a directory structure more appropriate for copying directly into an iOS/Android app as image assets.

[list="1"]
[*] Open a command prompt to the Composr installation directory.
[*] Type a command like:
[code="Bash"]
php data_custom/composr_mobile_sdk_build.php images <theme>
[/code]
For example, to export the [tt]example[/tt] theme:
[code="Bash"]
php data_custom/composr_mobile_sdk_build.php images example
[/code]
[*] Find the files have been generated under [tt]exports/composr_mobile_sdk/image_assets[/tt]
[*] Delete assets you don't want them copy through to your app
[/list]

[title="2"]Other approaches to mobile integration[/title]

On the [url="tracker"]http://compo.sr/tracker/search.php?tag_string=Type%3A+Mobile[/url] you will find a number of plans and issues relating to further development of Composr Mobile SDK. This is an active process, as we move forward a number of complementary alternative approaches, suited for different mobile integration/extension scenarios. As with all Composr development, development is primary implemented as a byproduct of commercial projects or direct feature sponsorship, but guided by a shared plan that benefits all interested users.

[title="3"]Tapatalk[/title]

There is an official Composr addon (non-bundled) for implementing Tapatalk support for Composr. Tapatalk is a third party forum app for smartphones that can connect to your own forum, providing a high-quality experience to users. Tapatalk will essentially function as an "out of the box Composr app", as we continue to extend our implementation to include other kinds of content within virtual-forums/virtual-topics.
