There is an option to allow people to e-mail in to the forums.

This requires:
1) The PHP IMAP extension to be installed
2) The PHP [tt]mail[/tt] command must work (on most servers this means a local SMTP server must be running [which can just relay to another if you wish]; on Windows it means the PHP SMTP settings must be correctly configured)
3) The software scheduler must be running (CRON)

Also recommended:
1) The mail server supports IMAP (not just POP3)
2) The mail server enforces SPF and DKIM, so that Composr can know that e-mails have legitimately come from where they claim to come from
3) The mail server enforce a reasonable maximum size for an individual e-mail, e.g. 5MB

Each individual forum is configured with its own mailing list settings, on the forum add/edit form. You can inherit settings from the IMAP configuration options, so long as each forum gets its own individual E-mail address and Username.

E-mails are bound to accounts via recognition of e-mail addresses. You can configure how to handle unrecognised addresses:
 - Block the posting
 - Automatically create an account (and e-mail the randomly-generated password back)
 - Post as guest

Forums with a mailing list configured will say so when the forum is viewed.

Members enable/disable the functionality from the notifications tab of their account settings. It is on by default. Users may wish to disable if they prefer to reduce their e-mail volume using the "Smart topic notification" setting.

Composr makes some attempt to clean up the e-mail text, so that the forum posts are not too much of a mess.
