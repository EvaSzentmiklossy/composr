There is an option to allow people to e-mail in to the forums.

This requires:
1) The PHP IMAP extension to be installed
2) The PHP [tt]mail[/tt] command must work (on most servers this means a local SMTP server must be running [which can just relay to another if you wish]; on Windows it means the PHP SMTP settings must be correctly configured)
3) The software scheduler must be running (CRON)

Also recommended:
1) The mail server supports IMAP (not just POP3)
2) The mail server enforces SPF and DKIM, so that Composr can know that e-mails have legitimately come from where they claim to come from
3) The mail server enforce a reasonable maximum size for an individual e-mail, e.g. 5MB

Each individual forum is configured with its own mailing list settings, on the forum add/edit form. You can inherit settings from the IMAP configuration options, so long as each forum gets its own individual E-mail address and Username.

E-mails are bound to accounts via recognition of e-mail addresses. You can configure how to handle unrecognised addresses:
 - Block the posting
 - Automatically create an account (and e-mail the randomly-generated password back)
 - Post as guest

Forums with a mailing list configured will say so when the forum is viewed.

Members enable/disable the functionality from the notifications tab of their account settings. It is on by default. Users may wish to disable if they prefer to reduce their e-mail volume using the "Smart topic notification" setting.

Composr makes some attempt to clean up the e-mail text, so that the forum posts are not too much of a mess.

[title="3"]Processing notes[/title]

Be aware of the following:
 - Comcode is generally processed with guest permissions, due to us not being able to perfectly confirm the poster is who they say they are.
 - Attachments provided are not fully protected from unauthorised access, due to the need for them be able to render with guest credentials.
 - Posting is tracked by marking e-mails read. If you mark an e-mail unread, it will post again. This can be useful for testing.

[title="3"]Specific mail servers[/title]

This section covers some advice for specific mail servers we have tested.

[title="4"]Gmail[/title]

Gmail can be highly problematic, and we were not able to get it to work reliably during testing due to automated threat detection measures running on Google's servers.
To get it to run you need to do the following:
 - Enable IMAP in the gmail settings of the account
 - Enable [url="less secure apps"]https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps[/url]
 - Either disable 2-step verification, or configure using app-specific passwords rather than the account password
 - You may need to do a [url="CAPTCHA unlock"]https://accounts.google.com/b/0/DisplayUnlockCaptcha[/url]

[title="4"]Zoho[/title]

For Zoho to work you just need to enable IMAP in your Zoho Mail account settings.
