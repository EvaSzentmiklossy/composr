[title sub="Written by Philip Withnall (ocProducts)"]Composr Tutorial: Running a discussion-forum-based helpdesk[/title]

Running an online helpdesk is something many companies will want to do. It allows customers to easily communicate via a website, suggesting new features, reporting bugs, or otherwise asking for support. This tutorial describes the facilities for this available in [concept]Conversr[/concept].

To add a multi-moderation, go to:
Admin Zone > Structure > Forums > Multi-moderations > Add multi-moderation
...and fill out all the fields on the form as required.
Try to make the post sound as professional as possible (if the multi-moderation is for making a formal response). Submit the form, and the multi-moderation will be available for use in all the specified forums (from the drop down list of topic actions that you see when viewing a topic).

Edit multi-moderations from:
Admin Zone > Structure > Forums > Multi-moderations > Edit multi-moderation.
You can delete a multi-moderation from the bottom of its edit form.

[media width="150" description="Applying a multi-moderation" float="right"]data_custom/images/docs/tut_forum_helpdesk/forum_helpdesk_using_multi_moderation.png[/media]
To use a multi-moderation, you need to browse to an appropriate topic. Select an appropriate multi-moderation from the 'Topic actions' drop-down list, and click the 'Proceed' button to apply the multi-moderation to the topic. Note that Composr comes with several pre-defined multi-moderations that are present from when you install Composr.

You may also use multi-moderations from the forum view screen, by selecting topics you want to multi-moderate and using a multi-moderation from the 'Topic actions' drop-down list.

[title="2"]Mass-moderation[/title]

On forum and topic view screens, you may select topics/posts with a checkbox, and execute actions upon them.

For forum view screens the actions are available in the 'Topic actions' drop-down list.

For topic view screens the actions are available in the 'Actions upon marked posts' drop-down list.

[title="2"]Post templates[/title]

[title="3"]Adding a post template[/title]

To add a post template, just open up the 'Add post template' screen in the Admin Zone (Go to Admin Zone > Structure > Forums > Post Templates), and fill in the forms.
You can delete a post template from the bottom of its edit form.

Composr provides useful features such as limiting the use of a post template to certain forums, making the post template the default post in the specified forums, and limiting use of the template to members of a certain minimum status.

To use a post template, simply submit a new topic or post using the verbose posting form (i.e. not the quick-reply box). On this form, if any post templates are defined for the current forum, a post template drop-down list will appear. Using this list, you can select a post template to use. If a post template has been marked as the default post for the current forum, the post field will already contain that post template.
